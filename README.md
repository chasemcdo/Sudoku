# Sudoku
Repository for my Sudoku Game and Solver

This is one of my personal projects to refine my abilites in Python and beyond.

The goal is to create a solver that can solve a given Sudoku board and to later create a playable game likely utilizing PyGame.


How to use:
In the Sudoku.py file, you'll find all the "brains" behind the solving and computation.


The "PyGameStuff.py" file is where the interface is created. This file will call upon the Sudoku.py file to solve and check.
Currently PyGameStuff pulls the "originalBoard" from Sudoku, but this may change in a future update and will be reflected in this document.
